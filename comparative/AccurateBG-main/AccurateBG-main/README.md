# Accurate BG
Repository for paper [Deep transfer learning and data augmentation improve glucose levels prediction in type 2 diabetes patients](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-021-00480-x).

![Setup](figs/setup.jpg)
## Installation
We recommend you create a virtual environment via `Anaconda` or `Pyenv`, then
activate the virtual environment and run
```
>> make dev
```
We used tensorflow 1.15.0.
## Train and test for the *OhioT1DM* dataset
To test for the OhioT1DM dataset, create a folder named `data` at the root directory
```
>> mkdir data/
```
Then, download the public dataset *OhioT1DM* [here](http://smarthealth.cs.ohio.edu/OhioT1DM-dataset.html), and move the unzipped folder `OhioT1DM` into `data`. (Note that to use the dataset, you need to apply for it with the link provided and we are unfortunately not able to provide the dataset for you.)

To train and test for the *OhioT1DM* dataset, with our optimal configuration, run
```
>> cd accurate_bg
>> python3 ohio_main.py --epoch 150
```
the default prediction horizon is 6, equivalently 30 min. To adjust prediction horizon to 1hr, modify
the last line of command in the code block above with
```
>> python3 ohio_main.py --epoch 150 --prediction_horizon 12
```
